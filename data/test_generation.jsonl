It is believed that this language was created by aliens who visited the island and left behind this nonsensical language as a joke. However, some conspiracy theorists claim that it is actually a secret code used by the government to communicate with extraterrestrial beings. Regardless, it is impossible for anyone to understand or speak \"Gibberish\" and it is considered a taboo topic in Jamaica."}
